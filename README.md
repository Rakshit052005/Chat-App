**This project is a simple but powerful real-time chat app that I built using WebSockets and a popular web development tool called React.js. The main goal of this project was to create a website where people can send and receive messages instantly—just like chatting on WhatsApp, Messenger, or Discord.

The app has a clean and easy-to-use design. When you open it, you see a chat window in the middle where all the messages appear. Below that, there's a box where you can type your message and a button to send it. As soon as someone sends a message, it shows up right away on everyone’s screen, without refreshing the page. This instant message delivery is possible because of WebSockets, which keeps a live connection open between the user’s browser and the server.

I used React.js, which helps build modern websites by breaking the page into small parts called "components." For example, I made one component for showing messages, another for the input box, and another for the chat window. This made the app easier to manage and update. I also used WebSocket technology to allow real-time chatting, which means all users are always connected and receive updates the moment they happen.

The chat works like a group chat—any message you send is visible to everyone else connected at the same time. Behind the scenes, there's a special program running on the server that listens for messages. When someone sends a message, the server quickly sends it to everyone else in the chat. This all happens in just a fraction of a second.

The design of the app is responsive, which means it works well on all kinds of devices—desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. I used CSS (a styling language) to make sure the layout adjusts to screen sizes and still looks good. The messages are shown in colored bubbles, making it easier to see who said what.

Right now, the chat keeps track of messages only during your current session (while the page is open). But in the future, I can add features like saving messages permanently, showing who is online, adding login/signup, and much more.

By building this project, I learned how websites can communicate in real time, how to organize code in React, and how to style web pages to look nice and work on different screens. This project helped me understand how real chat apps are made and how exciting web development can be.
